# Hello {{ recipient }}! #

## You need to buy a gift for {{ assignedName }}. ##

The {{ event_name }} Pollyanna has begun! Your gift should be approximately *{{ spending_limit }}*. You can find their Amazon wish list here:

    ### {{ assignedNameFull }} ###
    ### {{ amazonWishList }} ###

Please ensure that your gift arrives before {{ event_name }} so that your gift exchange can happen on time. We are doing a wrapping contest this year so be creative with the wrapping and after everyone opens presents, we will determine who has the best giftwrapping and they will win {{ reward }}. If you have any questions, please respond to this email.

Also, you will need to make sure that the items you want on *your* wishlist are on that list by *{{ due_date }}*.

Thank you!

{{ facilitator }}

P.S.: If you were assigned your spouse, or yourself, please email me immediately.
