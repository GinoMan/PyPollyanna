# Hello {{ recipient }}! #

## You need to buy a gift for {{ assignedName }}. ##

The Vincenzini Pollyanna has begun! Your gift should be approximately *$50*. You can find their Amazon wish list here:

    ### {{ assignedNameFull }} ###
    ### {{ amazonWishList }} ###

Please ensure that your gift arrives before Christmas so that your gift exchange can happen on time. We are doing a wrapping contest this year so be creative with the wrapping and after everyone opens presents, we will determine who has the best giftwrapping and they will win {{ reward }}. If you have any questions, please respond to this email.

Also, you will need to make sure that the items you want on *your* wishlist are on that list by *Saturday, December 4th 2021*.

Thank you!

Gino
